conventional error handling directly terminates the program in case of error
returns the value that indicates the error
don't invoke objects' desctructors before program terminates
terminates program using exit() or abort()


exception handling mechanism passes the information about the error from the location where error occurs to the location where error is handled. this solves the problem of communication.
